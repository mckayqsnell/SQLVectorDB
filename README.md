# SQLVectorDB

This project implements a vector-based podcast recommender system using PostgreSQL and the pgvector extension. It embeds transcript segments from the Lex Fridman Podcast into 128-dimensional vectors, stores them in Postgres, and supports semantic similarity queries. You can explore segment-level recommendations, find similar/dissimilar episodes, and experiment with various distance metrics directly in SQL. It showcases how to combine OpenAI embeddings, Python (psycopg2), and vector databases for scalable recommendation and search applications.
